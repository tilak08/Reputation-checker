# Reputation-checker
This is a python script to check for reputation which uses IPVOID for IP and Domain reputation check and VT for Hash reputaiton check.
Copy the script into a forlder along with the list of IP and domains in the same folder with .txt format.
An API key from IPVOID is needed and the out put will be .CSV format
The script for hash value check needs a file name apikeys.txt for the api keys from VT and hashes.txt to check the reputation of the hashes.
